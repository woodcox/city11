We meet in various homes around Beeston and North Leeds every fortnight on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday evenings (except on the first week of the month when it's the church prayer meetings). 

> All groups are meeting face to face, but for those who would prefer you can join all group group meetings via zoom. Please contact us to find out how to do this.

Our growth groups are a great way to meet with a small group from City to study the Bible together, pray and develop deeper relationships with each other. Please complete the get connected form if you would like to join a group and the growth group coordinator will get back to you.
