If you're in Leeds for university we'd love to welcome you.

Whether you’re a keen Christian or a sceptic trying to figure out the big questions of life, we want to give you the chance to develop spiritually – by learning from the Bible about who Jesus is, and what life with him is all about. We believe this happens best in the context of loving church community, where real friendships can be cultivated both with other students and with the wider church family! 


## Wider church life
We are passionate about students being integrated into the wider church family so that they feel at home in a family church. We love welcoming students and offering hospitality. If you wish, there are also opportunities to serve, come into church membership, and get to know other Christians outside the student bubble! All in all, our students are a core part of our church, and we want them to feel as much connection and ownership as anyone else in City Church! If you want to find out more please complete the get connected form below and we'll get back to you.
