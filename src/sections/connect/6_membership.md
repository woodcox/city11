Anyone is welcome to attend and get involved in church life here, but we invite you to consider becoming a formal member.

Becoming a formal member means making a voluntary promise or commitment to associate yourself with a group of Christian believers.

It means committing to attend, pray for, give to and serve the church family. More than this though, choosing to be a formal member is a statement that you want the other members to help and support you in your Christian life. 

We believe that membership in a local church is a vital part of a Christian's spiritual life. 

And we believe it's a counter-cultural and life-giving commitment to make!

## Who can become a member?

Anybody who is willing to commit to being part of our church family, can commit to our beliefs about God, the bible and Jesus, and respect our doctrinal distinctives.

If you have any questions or would like to become a member, please get in touch by completing our get connected form below.
