One of the best ways to build friendships at church is to join one of our volunteer teams. They are a great way to meet likeminded people and they also give everyone a chance to play their part.

We want to be people who are generous in the way we give our time and our talents and there’s something for everyone. Here’s a list of all of the volunteer teams you could be a part of:

> Kids / Youth / Welcome / Worship / Sound and Media / Building / Women's ministry / Care / Students

If you are interested in joining a team the best thing to do is fill in our Connect form below or chat to a <a href="/about/#leaders">leader</a> on a Sunday.
